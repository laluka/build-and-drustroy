# Build And Drustroy

## Desc

- I love rust because it's secure and fast. So I want people to do MOAR rust.
- That's why I made a microservice to allow fast and easy remote code compilation.
- Send my your code, I'll compile it, and I know for sure I'm safe!

## Goal

- Abuse build.rs to inject a compile-time command executions
- Spawn a shell
- Read flag
